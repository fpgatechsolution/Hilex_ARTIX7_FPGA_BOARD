INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 2 threads
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Inst_LCD_4BIT/dataout_s is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Inst_LCD_4BIT/dataout_s_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell Inst_LCD_4BIT/dataout_s_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
